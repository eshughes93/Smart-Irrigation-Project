Smart Irrigation Project for CMPS 115, Fall 2014

Project overview:
    To create a self-contained, scalable, autonomous irrigation system 
    for use in urban and commercial farms. The system must be easy to use 
    (if user interaction is necessary), environmentally smart (don't water
    too much), and RELIABLE. Builds off of a former project at Natural 
    Bridges High School.

	   Computer Science B.S. major. The majority of my programming experience has been in C and C++,
	   though I pick up on new things very quickly. I'm thoroughly looking forward to working on this
	   project because I think we're all going to learn a lot!

        About:
           I am a Computer Science B.A. and Earth Science B.S. double major in my last quarter. I program primarily in Python, but I am experienced in C++ and C. I have little experience with electrical engineering (took CMPE 12 two years ago), but I am very interested in learning the basics with Arduinos or similar. This project looks really cool and I'm excited to be a part of this team!
