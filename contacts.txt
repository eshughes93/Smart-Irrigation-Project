	   Computer Science B.S. major. The majority of my programming experience has been in C and C++,
	   though I pick up on new things very quickly. I'm thoroughly looking forward to working on this
	   project because I think we're all going to learn a lot!

           I am a Computer Science B.A. and Earth Science B.S. double major in my last quarter. I program primarily in Python, but I am experienced in C++ and C. I have little experience with electrical engineering (took CMPE 12 two years ago and E&M physics like 6 years ago), but I am very interested in learning the basics with Arduinos or similar. This project looks really cool and I'm excited to be a part of this team!
