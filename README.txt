Welcome to the Smart Irrigation Project.

For the TAs:
    The location of our deliverables:
        User Manual: documents > user-docs > User_Manual_Smart_Irrigation.pdf
        Problem Report: documents > user-docs > problem-report.txt
        Test Document: documents > scrum-docs > SmartIrrigationTestingDoc.pdf

For everyone else:
    You should check out the User Manual located in documents > user-docs. 
    It will answer all your questions. Just do it.

    documents > user-docs is for documents which aim to help someone understand our system. Note that our diagrams were created with a program called Dia. It is open source (free to download), so you should have no problem editing them if you would like.

    documents > scrum-docs is for documents specific to our development process. As you may have guessed, we used SCRUM to some degree.
